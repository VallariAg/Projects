# Chess

The game of chess made while learning C++

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Install `CodeBlocks` from [here](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26) or `VS code` from [here]()


### Installing
Run the .cpp file on `CodeBlocks` 

For `VS Code`, install [mingw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) to run C/C++ codes, and install following [these](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) guidelines 

## Usage

This is a regular two player chess game where all the rules are to be followed.

* The white pieces are lower cased and the black ones are in upper case.
* To move a piece, enter x (vertical) and y (horizontal) co-ordinates. First, enter the inital co-ordinates and then the final ones, where you want the specific piece to go.  
*  Moving pieces against the rules will diaplay an error and a request to re-enter co-ordinates.
